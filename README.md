# Here we go

Some weirdo old school type of game I'm having fun with.

### Next up todo:
- Add a module library so I don't have to put every fucking thing on the window object
- Move player object into its own file

### Features to add soon:
- Add some more entities. People to talk to, enemies to fight or something.
- Save player position, time of day, experience points
- Allow the player to level up
- add some animations or some visual indication that you're hitting an enemy
- Come up with game mechanics that make the game really unique and fun (jk)
- maybe use something else than drawings for each of the characters?
- Make player movement be more flexible.. possibly able to move at an angle

### Features to add one day, probably by somebody smarter than me
- Make the lighting better, smarter - right now it's barely enough to make
  night time a bit more interesting.

### Installation:

It's actually just plain html + js so far, so you can just run it from the file
system. http server not even required.

However: currently the game is 100% chrome only. There are plans to support
firefox as well, but that will probably not be very soon
