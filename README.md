Some weirdo old school type of game I'm having fun with.

### Next up todo:
- Add a module library so I don't have to put every fucking thing on the window object
- Move player object into its own file
- Move the game entitiy stuff into its own file
- Fix the view scrolling to move views instead of using the screen scroll
- Make a better map - should it be like something?

### Features to add soon:
- Add more types of land/terrain (Roads, etc)
- Add some more entities. People to talk to, enemies to fight or something.
- Save player position
- Come up with game mechanics that make the game really unique and fun (jk)
