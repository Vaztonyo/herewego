# Here we go

Some weirdo old school type of game I'm having fun with.

[Try demo](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/647738/demos/herewego/index.html)

### Next up todo:
- Move player object into its own file
- Allow the player to distribute attribute points
- Find a way to centralize attribute calculations, possibly on the entity?
- re-render (at least lights) more often - now it's just happening when you move or
  an alien shows up

### Features to add soonish:
- Add a module library. Should probably be easy to drop in browserify or something.
- Save player position, time of day, experience points when you quit the tab
- Come up with game mechanics that make the game really unique and fun (jk)
- Come up with some sort of storyline?
- Make aliens move and attack the player and each other
- Allow the player to talk to cowboy guys and other people

### Content to add/change:
- maybe use something else than drawings for each of the characters?
- Add more houses
- And more types of people
- More types of enemies.. possibly red aliens etc

### Features to add one day, probably by somebody smarter than me:
- Make the lighting better, smarter - right now it's barely enough to make
  night time a bit more interesting.

### Installation:

It's actually just plain html + js so far, so you can just run it from the file
system. http server not even required.

However: currently the game is 100% chrome only. There are plans to support
firefox as well, but that will probably not be very soon
